This project looks at the different features of a home to see how the features impact the selling price of house. Some of features included the type of house it was, the square footage of the basement, the kind of garage and more. Looking at the the data, there was a lot of EDA that needed to be done. Not all of the houses had all the features. Also there were a bunch of categorical features that needed to be changed to numerical values in order to be analyzied. 

After the EDA was completed I took those features and ran linear models on the data in order to see how those features impacting the saleprcing of the house. I found the best model out of the three to then take that model to select the top ten features that affected the selling price the most. 

These features that were the top ten highest scoring features that impacted a housing selling price, can then be used to focus on future house and their selling prices. For example, if the basement type has a lot of square footage in the basement then the it will sell well at a higher price. Alterately if the house is in the neighborhood of Old Town or Edwards then the chance of selling it at higher price will be a lot lower. 

The features that add the most to the value of a home in descending order:

    the basement type square footage,
    2nd floor square footage,
    1st floor square footage,
    overall quality,
    garage that is in typical or average condition,
    gargage that is excellent condition,
    lot area,
    pool quality that is in good condition,
    Single-family Detached house,
    and year built.

    neighborhood - Edwards,
    neighborhood - Old Town,
